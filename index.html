          &emsp;&emsp;"Pegasus is a winged horse in Greek mythology, usually
          depicted as a white stallion. He was sired by Poseidon, in his role as
          horse-god, and foaled by the Gorgon Medusa. Pegasus was the brother of
          Chrysaor, both born when their mother was decapitated by Perseus.
          Greco-Roman poets wrote about his ascent to heaven after his birth and
          his obeisance to Zeus, who instructed him to bring lightning and
          thunder from Olympus. <br >
          &emsp;&emsp;Pegasus is the creator of Hippocrene, the fountain on
          Mount Helicon. He was captured by the Greek hero Bellerophon, near the
          fountain Peirene, with the help of Athena and Poseidon. Pegasus
          allowed Bellerophon to ride him in order to defeat the monster
          Chimera, which led to many more exploits. Bellerophon later fell from
          Pegasus's back while trying to reach Mount Olympus. Both Pegasus and
          Bellerophon were said to have died at the hands of Zeus for trying to
          reach Olympus. Other tales have Zeus bring Pegasus to Olympus to carry
          his thunderbolts. <br >
          &emsp;&emsp;Long honored as a constellation, Pegasus is a subject of
          very rich iconography, especially through ancient Greek pottery as
          well as paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance."
