                The tale of Bellerophon is the most famous story involving
                Pegasus. Bellerophon tamed Pegasus with the help of Athena and
                Poseidon (familiar players from
                <a href="./creation.html">Pegasus' creation</a>). Bellerophon
                rode Pegasus into battle against the monstrous Chimera, a fire
                breathing monster with the body of a lion, the head of a goat,
                and the tail of a serpent. As a team, Pegasus and Bellerophon
                defeated the Chimera making Bellerophon one of the legendary
                heros in Greek mythology.

                In Jason's epic quest with the Argonauts to retrieve the Golden
                Fleece, Pegasus is said to have appeared and aided Jason. While
                Pegasus is not a central figure in Jason's story, Pegasus is
                part of the broader mythological context.

                During the Gigantomachy, the gigantic battle between the gods of
                Olympus and the Giants, Pegasus helped the gods in their fight
                (most likely paying tribute to the gods for Pegasus' impossible
                creation). Pegasus is said to have carried Zeus' thunderbolts on
                the battlefield allowing Zeus to unleash his mighty weapon from
                the skys.

                Pegasus also played a role in the birth of the Muses. The Muses
                are the goddesses of inspiration and the arts. Pegasus has an
                amazing ability that wherever his hoof strikes springs arise
                from the ground. Pegasus struck the ground on Mount Helicon,
                creating the Hippocrene Spring, a source of poetic inpiration,
                which led to the birth of the Muses.

                Pegasus is often mentioned in many demi-god and hero adventures.
                Pegasus often represents a level of divine intervention and
                support from the gods. While Pegasus is not always a central
                figure, its appearance in these stories demonstrates Pegasus'
                status as a popular and powerful divine and mythical creature
                associated with heroic deeds and epic journeys.
